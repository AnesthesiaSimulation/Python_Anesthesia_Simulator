# Python_Anesthesia_Simulator

This repository includes the Python Anesthesia Simulator (PAS), used to perform multi-drugs anesthesia simulation in order to evaluate the performance of a given controller. The models used are mostly a translation of the Matlab [https://fr.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/85208-open-source-patient-simulator][open-source simulator] proposed in  by Ionescu \textit{et al.}. Different drugs along with different well-know models are available. The output are the Bispectral Index (BIS), Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP), Cardiac Output (CO), Neuro-Muscular-Blockade (NMB) and Ramsay agitation Sedation Scale (RASS). The Simulator also includes common disturbance profiles, measurement noise and an option to process Monte-Carlo simulation with intra-patient variability. Finally, the computation of the most commonly performance index used in the control community is also handle.
